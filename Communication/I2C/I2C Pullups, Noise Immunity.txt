I2C pull-ups
------------

Per specs the total number of parallel pullups must not produce a 
current of more than 3mA. For a 5V bus:
I (mA) = 5V / R (kΩ)   -> Rmin = 5V / 3mA = 1.66kΩ

Measure: 
Attach all the used I2C peripherals to your Arduino, upload the
I2C_Controller.ino sketch and with a multimeter measure the current 
drawn when shorting SDA / SCL to GND.

Level shifters:
If you have level shifters, then there is often a 10kΩ before the level
shifter and a 10kΩ after the level shifter. The current needed to 
tie down SDA or SCL to GND is the sum from both sides:
5V / 10kΩ = 0.5mA
3.3V / 10kΩ = 0.33mA
-> the 3mA budget will now decrease by 0.83mA, you only have 2.17mA


Increase noise immunity
-----------------------

RS-485 and CAN bus are the best choice for noise immunity. But noise
immunity can also be achieved to a certain degree for I2C:

1. Use a good grounding system for all modules.

2. Never twist the SDA and SCL lines around each other because that
   would increase crosstalk. Keep SDA and SCL far apart from each other.
   Use a grounded shielded cable for SCL and another one for SDA. Or 
   just twist SCL with a GND line and SDA with a second GND line.
   Alternatively, the SCL line can be twisted with the GND line, and
   the SDA line twisted with the VDD line. In the latter case, 
   capacitors must be used to decouple the VDD line to the GND line at 
   both ends of the twisted pairs
   (see I2C specs "UM10204" - "7.5 Wiring pattern of the bus lines").
   
   Note that coax or twisted pairs can increase the bus capacitance 
   (specs says 400pF max) and thus increase also the rise time (specs 
   says 1uS max) so that to obviate that we must lower the pull-ups.
   
3. Use RC filters, see Improving Noise Immunity for Serial Interface.pdf

4. Star vs. daisy-chain configuration won't really make a difference.
