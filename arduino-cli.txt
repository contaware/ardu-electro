Setup
-----

The CLI executable is located under the resources/app/lib/backend/resources
directory within the IDE installation. Add that directory to your PATH.

Hint: make sure to close the Arduino IDE before using the command line 
      as it may interfere with your results.

Show version:
$ arduino-cli version


FQBN
----

fqbn = <package>:<architecture>:<board>

<package> is the vendor identifier,
       typically: arduino, adafruit, ...
       see: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages
<architecture> is the microcontroller architecture, 
       like: avr, megaavr, renesas_uno, samd, ...
<board> is the board name defined by the core platform,
       like uno, unor4wifi, nano, ...

List all boards to get the fqbn:
$ arduino-cli board listall


Compile, Upload and Test
------------------------

List of connected boards:
$ arduino-cli board list

Create a new sketch (provide the directory which must not exist):
$ arduino-cli sketch new "C:\Users\xyz\Downloads\test"

Compiling a sketch (provide the sketch directory):
$ arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:avr:uno "C:\Users\xyz\Downloads\test"
Note: on error the exit code is always 1 instead of 0.

Upload a sketch (provide the sketch directory):
$ arduino-cli upload --port COM24 --fqbn arduino:avr:uno "C:\Users\xyz\Downloads\test"
Hint: get port from the list of connected boards.

Get output from Serial Monitor to your terminal:
$ arduino-cli monitor --port COM24
If using a baudrate other than 9600, add the following option:
--config baudrate=115200


Cores and Libraries Management
------------------------------

List the installed cores:
$ arduino-cli core list

Install a core:
$ arduino-cli core install arduino:samd

List the installed libraries:
$ arduino-cli lib list

Search for libraries:
$ arduino-cli lib search DHT11

Install a library:
$ arduino-cli lib install "DHT sensor library"

Warning: Arduino IDE built-in libraries are excluded from the build when 
         running arduino-cli. If a compilation fails for a missing 
         bundled library, fix that by installing the missing library 
         from the library manager.
