Mono-directional with voltage divider
-------------------------------------

1. 3.3V -> 5V: 5V Arduinos recognize 3.3V as HIGH, so going from a 3.3V 
   part to a 5V Arduino pin does not need a level shifter. 

2. 5V -> 3.3V: a level shifter is needed to avoid breaking the 3.3V 
   device. Use 1kΩ and 2kΩ or 1.8kΩ and 3.6kΩ resistors to make a 
   voltage divider.


Mono-directional chips (faster than voltage dividers)
-----------------------------------------------------

1. 3.3V -> 5V: the 74AHCT125 is powered by 5V and will detect 3.3V input 
   levels.

2. 5V -> 3.3V: the 74LVC244/74LVC245 can be powered by 1.65V - 3.6V and 
   they will output that voltage. They can tolerate up to 5.5V on their 
   inputs. For the 74LVC245 remember to set the direction pin. 
   The CD4050B can be powered by 3V - 18V and it will output that voltage.
   It tolerates up to 18V on its inputs.


Bi-directional chips (manual direction)
---------------------------------------

There are the 74LVC1T45, 74LVC2T45 or 74LVC8T245 chips which can 
translate 1, 2 or 8 signals. All three have a DIR pin and the 74LVC8T245 
has also a OE pin.


Bi-directional chips (automatic direction)
------------------------------------------

TXB0104 (marking YE04) and TXB0108 (marking YE08) are fast bi-directional 
level shifters, but these chips do not work with I2C or any open-drain 
bus using strong (small resistance) pull-ups.


Bi-directional for I2C (automatic direction)
--------------------------------------------

1. There are many modules built on the BSS138 MOSFETs that work down to 
   1.8V on the lower voltage side, and up to 10V on the higher voltage 
   side. Those modules have 10kΩ pull-ups.
   Attention: when replacing the BSS138 with another MOSFET choose one 
              with a maximum Vgs(th) of 1.5V or less. 

2. We also have the TXS0104E (marking YF04E) and TXS0108E (marking YF08E) 
   chips which are pin compatible to the TXB0104 and TXB0108 ones, but 
   internally they are quite different, they do work with both push-pull 
   and open-drain. The TXS0104E is similar to the discrete BSS138 design 
   and it also has built-in 10kΩ pull-ups. The TXS0108E design is quite 
   complex, it implements dynamic pull-ups, it is fast, but prone to 
   oscillations if not used correctly.

3. There is also a chip exclusively dedicated to I2C, it's the PCA9306.


I2C without level shifters?
---------------------------

Since the devices on the I2C bus don't actually drive the signals HIGH, 
I2C allows for some flexibility in connecting devices with different I/O 
voltages: the trick is to connect the pull-up resistors to the lower of 
the two voltages, but be aware that this only works when the voltage of 
the lower voltage system exceeds the high-level input voltage of the 
higher voltage system (for example a 5V Arduino and a 3.3V module).

The Arduino Mega 2560 has 10kΩ pull-up resistors on the SDA and SCL 
lines connected to 5V. If a level shifter is not an option, it's 
possible to add an additional 1.8kΩ pull-up that goes to 3.3V, this will 
result in a 3.56V I2C bus which is still within the 3.3V chip specs.
