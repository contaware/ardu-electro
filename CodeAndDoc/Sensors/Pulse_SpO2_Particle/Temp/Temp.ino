/*
  The chip runs at 1.8V, for the I2C interface some modules have level 
  shifters built-in, others have pull-ups to 1.8V or 3.3V.
  
  For the modules with 1.8V pull-ups some people suggest to disconnect
  the module pull-ups and do external pull-ups to 3.3V or 5V, that
  should be ok because the maximum rating according to the datasheet for
  "All Other Pins to GND" is -0.3V to +6.0V. Adding additional 4.7K 
  pull-ups to 5V without disconnecting the existing 4.7K pull-ups also
  works (the bus high voltage is then 3.4V)

  Note: MAX30102 has IR and red LEDs
        MAX30105 has IR, red and green LEDs
