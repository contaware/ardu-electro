I2C pull-ups
------------

Per specs the total number of parallel pullups must not produce a 
current of more than 3mA. For a 5V bus:

I (mA) = 5V / R (kΩ)

-> Rmin = 5V / 3mA = 1.66 kΩ


Level shifters
--------------

If you have level shifters, then there is often a 10kΩ before the level
shifter and a 10kΩ after the level shifter. The current needed to 
tie down SDA or SCL to GND is the sum from both sides:
5V / 10kΩ = 0.5mA
3.3V / 10kΩ = 0.33mA
-> that results in a current of 0.83mA
