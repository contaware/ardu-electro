The baud-rate is defined as the maximum amount of signal state changes 
(or symbols) per second. 

To create a two-way communication system a minimum of three wires are 
needed Tx, Rx and GND. The two parts must always be configured with the 
same baud-rate, data word size, parity scheme and stop bits count. The 
most common is 9600 8N1, which means a baud-rate of 9600, 8 bits data 
words, no parity and one stop bit. In this case the bytes-rate is about 
1/10th of the baud-rate because 10 bits are needed (8 data bits + start 
and stop bits). So 9600 bauds are about 960 bytes/sec.

The communication happens without a clock, the receiver synchronizes to 
the start signal edge on the line and creates its own clock which 
samples in the middle of each bit. For example with a baud-rate of 2400 
(2400bps) the bit period will be 1/2400 = 416.6us. 

Data bits:
The character length is between 5 bits and 9 bits. If it's not 
otherwise stated, the data is transferred least-significant bit (lsb) 
first.

Synchronization bits:
An idle line is at 1. The start bit is always indicated by an idle data 
line going from 1 to 0, while the stop bit(s), which can be 1, 1.5, or 
2 bit periods, will transition back to the idle state by holding the 
line at 1.

Parity bit:
For even parity the parity bit must be set so that the amount of binary 
1s in data bits + parity bit add up to an even number. For odd parity 
the sum of the 1s must be odd instead of even.

Signal levels: 
        TTL           RS-232        
0       0V            +3..+15V    
1       3.3-5.0V      −15..−3V     

The −3..+3V range is not a valid RS-232 level.
