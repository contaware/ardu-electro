/*
  Control an analog RGB led

  - RGB LEDs have three LEDs inside them which share either a 
    common anode or a common cathode (longest lead).

  - Connect the common cathode to GND, or if it's a common anode,
    connect it to VCC.

  - Connect each color through a 330Î© resistor to the respective
    analog pin defined below.
