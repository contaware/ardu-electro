Buck converter
--------------

When the switch is closed, the increasing current will produce a 
voltage across the inductor terminals that counteracts the voltage of 
the input and therefore reduces the net voltage across the load. During 
this time, the inductor stores energy in the form of a magnetic field.

When the switch is opened, the switch side of the inductor becomes 
negative because the inductor's magnetic field continues to support the 
current flow. The diode starts to conduct and permits the current flow 
avoiding voltage spikes across the switch. The inductor voltage is now 
the output voltage given by the current through the load.


Boost converter
---------------

When the switch is closed, current flows through the inductor and the 
inductor stores energy by generating a magnetic field. 

When the switch is opened, the inductor's magnetic field maintains the 
current which now flows towards the load through the diode. The inductor 
polarity will be reversed and as a result, two sources will be in series
causing a higher output voltage.


Inverting Buck-Boost converter
------------------------------

like Boost:
When the switch is closed, current flows through the inductor and the 
inductor stores energy by generating a magnetic field. 

like Buck:
When the switch is opened, the inductor's magnetic field maintains the 
current which now flows towards the load through the diode. The inductor 
voltage is now the output voltage given by the current through the load.
