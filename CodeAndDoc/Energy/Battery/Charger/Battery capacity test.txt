Lead-Acid battery capacity test
-------------------------------

1. Fully charge the battery, it should complete at 2.40V / cell.

2. To get accurate readings, the battery needs to rest in the open 
   circuit state for at least 1h and no more than 24h. 

3. Discharge the battery in 5-8 hours to an end voltage of 1.75V / cell.
   Interrupt the test if an individual cell voltage is less than 1V.


Li-Ion 3.7V battery capacity test
---------------------------------

1. Fully charge the battery to 4.2V.

2. To get accurate readings, the battery needs to rest in the open 
   circuit state for at least 1h and no more than 24h. 
   
3. Discharge with 0.5C and set the termination voltage to 3V.


LiFePO4 3.2V battery capacity test
----------------------------------

1. Fully charge the battery to 3.65V.

2. To get accurate readings, the battery needs to rest in the open 
   circuit state for at least 1h and no more than 24h. 
   
3. Discharge with 0.5C and set the termination voltage to 2.5V.


Depth of Discharge (DoD)
------------------------

- Flooded lead-acid batteries have a DoD of 50%.
- Gel & AGM lead-acid batteries can be discharged to 70%.
- Li-Ion batteries can be discharged to 80%.
- LiFePO4 batteries can be discharged to almost 100%.

Note that the cycles of life for all battery types will be reduce with 
continuous high DoD, but for a single capacity test, it's not a problem 
to completely discharge a battery.
