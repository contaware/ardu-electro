For Windows 7 installation copy nanoesp32.inf to
(create the prewin10 subfolder): 
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arduino15\packages\arduino\hardware\esp32\2.0.11\drivers\prewin10"

Now if already installed, but not working, uninstall the driver from
Device Manager by ticking "Delete the driver software for this device"
and then (re-)install it.
