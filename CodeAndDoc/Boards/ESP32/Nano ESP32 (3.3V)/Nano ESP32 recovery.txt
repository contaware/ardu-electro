Arduino Bootloader Mode
-----------------------

The Arduino Bootloader-mode is useful if your Nano ESP32 becomes 
undetectable/misidentified or is not able to upload sketches:

1. Press the reset button, and then press it again once you see the 
   RGB LED flashing. You'll know that you've successfully entered 
   bootloader-mode if you see the RGB LED pulsing slowly.
   
2. Select Arduino Nano ESP32 in Arduino IDE.

3. Upload any sketch to restore the standard Arduino bootloader.
