  BluePill+ Test

  - The LED is connected between PB2 and GND.

  - The key button is connected between PA0 and 3.3V.
    Note: all GPIOs have internal pull-ups and pull-downs of 40kÎ©.
  
  - Analog pins are A0..A9 (we can also use PA0..PB1), the resolution is 12-bit. 
    Attention: A0 is PA0 and it is used by the key button!
