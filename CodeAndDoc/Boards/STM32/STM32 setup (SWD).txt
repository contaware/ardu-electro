Connect the ST-Link programmer/debugger to the STM32 board like:

STM32                                                            ST-Link
-----                                                            -------
GND                                  <->                             GND
SWDIO/SWO                            <->                           SWDIO
SWCLK/SWSCK                          <->                           SWCLK
3.3V                                 <->                            3.3V
ST-Link V2.1 or higher have also a UART (for Serial print):
A10=RX (MCU point of view)           <->           TX (PC point of view)
A9 =TX (MCU point of view)           <->           RX (PC point of view)

1. Install Arduino IDE.

2. File - Preferences - "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
   https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/main/package_stmicroelectronics_index.json

3. Tools - Board - Boards Manager... install:
   STM32 by STMicroelectronics
   Attention: core release 2.8.0 or higher only supports Arduino IDE 2,
              use core 2.7.1 for Arduino IDE 1.

4. To have all the necessary tools we need to download and install the
   STM32CubeProg software from ST:
   https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html

5. Select
   Tools - Board - STM32 MCU based boards - Generic STM32F1 series
   Then choose the "Board part number", like for example:
   "BluePill F103C8"

6. Set the Upload Method to:
   "STM32CubeProgrammer (SWD)".

7. If you have a board with jumpers, make sure that both BOOT0 and BOOT1 
   are at the default position 0.

8. Now you can click on the Arduino IDE's Upload button.


Note: ST-Link drivers should be installed by the STM32CubeProg setup
      program. If it's not the case, download them from ST:
      https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html
      then unzip the archive, right-click on "stlink_winusb_install.bat" 
      and choose "Run as administrator".
