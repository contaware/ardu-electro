By default STM32 chips cannot be programmed over the USB port, but each 
STM32 chip has an embedded USART bootloader in System Memory that ships 
factory installed. This bootloader uses the USART1 peripheral, logic 
levels are 3.3V, but fortunately the USART1 pins are 5V-tolerant, so we 
can use a USB to TTL adapter with 3.3V or 5V signal levels. 
Connect it like:

STM32 Blue/Black Pill                                 USB to TTL Adapter
---------------------                                 ------------------
GND                                  <->                             GND
(P)A10=RX (MCU point of view)        <->        TX(D) (PC point of view)
(P)A9 =TX (MCU point of view)        <->        RX(D) (PC point of view)
3.3V                                 <->                            3.3V
ATTENTION: disconnect MCU's USB cable if powering from USB to TTL Adapter!


1. Install Arduino IDE.

2. File - Preferences - "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
   https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/main/package_stmicroelectronics_index.json

3. Tools - Board - Boards Manager... install:
   STM32 by STMicroelectronics
   Attention: core release 2.8.0 or higher only supports Arduino IDE 2,
              use core 2.7.1 for Arduino IDE 1.

4. To have all the necessary tools we need to download and install the
   STM32CubeProg software from ST:
   https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html

5. Select
   Tools - Board - STM32 MCU based boards - Generic STM32F1 series
   or
   Tools - Board - STM32 MCU based boards - Generic STM32F4 series
   Then choose the "Board part number", like for example:
   "BluePill F103C8"
   or
   "BlackPill F411CE"

6. Set the Upload Method to:
   "STM32CubeProgrammer (Serial)".

7. Enter bootloader mode:
   1. Press and hold the BOOT0 button (or set BOOT0 jumper to 1).
   2. Press and release NRST (reset) button to power cycle the MCU.
   3. Release BOOT0 button (or set BOOT0 jumper to 0).

8. Now you can click on the Arduino IDE's Upload button.
