Mono-directional with voltage divider
-------------------------------------

1. 3.3V -> 5V: 5V Arduinos recognize 3.3V as HIGH, so going from a 3.3V 
   part to a 5V Arduino pin does not need a level shifter. 

2. 5V -> 3.3V: a level shifter is needed to avoid breaking the 3.3V 
   device. Use 1k and 2k or 1.8k and 3.6k resistors to make a voltage 
   divider.


Mono-directional chips (faster than voltage dividers)
-----------------------------------------------------

1. 3.3V -> 5V: the 74AHCT125 is powered by 5V and will detect 3.3V input 
   levels.

2. 5V -> 3.3V: the 74LVC244/74LVC245 can be powered by 1.65V - 3.6V and 
   they will output that voltage. They can tolerate up to 5.5V on their 
   inputs. For the 74LVC245 remember to set the direction pin. 
   The CD4050B can be powered by 3V - 18V and it will output that voltage.
   It tolerates up to 18V on its inputs.


Bi-directional
--------------

TXB0104 (marking YE04) and TXB0108 (marking YE08) are fast bi-directional 
level shifters, but these chips do not work with I2C or any open-drain 
bus using strong (small resistance) pull-ups.


Bi-directional for I2C
----------------------

1. Since the devices on the I2C bus don't actually drive the signals 
   HIGH, I2C allows for some flexibility in connecting devices with 
   different I/O voltages. In general, in a system where one device is 
   at a higher voltage than another, it may be possible to connect the 
   two devices via I2C without any level shifting circuitry in between 
   them. The trick is to connect the pull-up resistors to the lower of 
   the two voltages. This only works in some cases, where the lower of 
   the two system voltages exceeds the high-level input voltage of the 
   higher voltage system. For example a 5V Arduino and a 3.3V module. 

2. There are many modules built on the BSS138 MOSFETs that work down to 
   1.8V on the lower voltage side, and up to 10V on the higher voltage 
   side. Those modules have 10k pull-ups.
   Attention: when replacing the BSS138 with another MOSFET choose one 
              with a maximum Vgs(th) of 1.5V or less. 

3. We also have the TXS0104E (marking YF04E) and TXS0108E (marking YF08E) 
   chips which are pin compatible to the TXB0104 and TXB0108 ones, but 
   internally they are quite different, they do work with both push-pull 
   and open-drain. The TXS0104E is similar to the discrete BSS138 design 
   and it also has built-in 10k pull-ups. The TXS0108E design is quite 
   complex, it implements dynamic pull-ups, it is fast, but prone to 
   oscillations if not used correctly.
   There is also a chip exclusively dedicated to I2C, it's the PCA9306.


Arduino Mega 2560 I2C board pull-ups
------------------------------------

The Arduino Mega 2560 is the only board with 10k pull-up resistors on 
the SDA and SCL lines. Because those 10k pull-up resistors on the board 
are connected to +5V, the I2C bus is a 5V I2C bus. If a level shifter is 
not an option, it's possible to add an additional 1k8 pull-up that goes 
to 3.3V, this will result in a 3.56V I2C bus which is still within the 
3.3V chip specs.
