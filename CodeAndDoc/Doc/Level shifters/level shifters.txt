Mono-directional with voltage divider
-------------------------------------

Arduino recognizes 3.3V as HIGH, so going from 3.3V to an Arduino pin 
does not need a level shifter. While when going from 5V Arduino to 3.3V 
parts you need a level shifter. The simplest is to use 1K and 2K or 1.8K 
and 3.6K resistors to make a voltage divider from an Arduino 5V pin to a 
Module 3.3V pin. 


Mono-directional
----------------

The 74LVC245 is quite fast and better than a simple voltage divider. It 
is manually bi-directional (it will not auto-detect the direction like
the chips below).


Bi-directional
--------------

TXB0104 and TXB0108 are fast bi-directional level shifters, the only 
thing that doesn't work well with these chips is I2C which uses strong 
(small resistance) pull-ups that confuse the auto-direction sensor. 
If you need to use pull-ups, you can but they should be at least 50K ohm,
the ones internal to AVRs/Arduino are about 100K ohm so those are OK!


Bi-directional for I2C
----------------------

Since the devices on the bus don't actually drive the signals high, I2C 
allows for some flexibility in connecting devices with different I/O 
voltages. In general, in a system where one device is at a higher 
voltage than another, it may be possible to connect the two devices via 
I2C without any level shifting circuitry in between them. The trick is 
to connect the pull-up resistors to the lower of the two voltages. This 
only works in some cases, where the lower of the two system voltages 
exceeds the high-level input voltage of the the higher voltage 
system. For example a 5V Arduino and a 3.3V module. For voltages lower
than 3.3V it's necessary to use a I2C capable level shifter built with
BSS138 MOSFETs like the adafruit 4-channel I2C-safe Bi-directional Logic
Level Converter that works down to 1.8V on the low side, and up to 10V
on the high side. The 10K's of this module do make the interface a 
little more sluggish than using a TXB0104/TXB0108 or a 74LVC245.
Attention: when replacing the BSS138 with another MOSFET pay attention
to choose one with a maximum Vgs(th) of 1.5V or less.

Arduino Mega 2560 I2C board pull-ups
------------------------------------

The Arduino Mega 2560 is the only board with 10k pull-up resistors on 
the SDA and SCL lines. Because those 10k pull-up resistors on the board 
are connected to +5V, the I2C bus is a 5V I2C bus. If a level shifter is 
not an option, it's possible to add an additional 1k8 pull-up that goes 
to 3.3V, this will result in a 3.56V I2C bus which is still within the 
3.3V chip specs.
