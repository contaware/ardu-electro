Voltage divider
---------------

Arduino recognizes 3.3V as HIGH, so going from 3.3V to an Arduino pin 
does not need a level shifter. While when going from 5V Arduino to 3.3V 
parts you need a level shifter. The simplest is to use 1K and 2K or 1.8K 
and 3.6K resistors to make a voltage divider from an Arduino 5V pin to a 
Module 3.3V pin. 


adafruit 4-channel I2C-safe Bi-directional Logic Level Converter
----------------------------------------------------------------

This breakout has 4 BSS138 FETs with 10K pullups. It works down to 1.8V 
on the low side, and up to 10V on the high side. The 10Kâ€™s do make the 
interface a little more sluggish than using a TXB0108 or 74LVC245 so we 
suggest checking those out if you need high-speed transfer. 

Attention: the other level shifters are not working with I2C!
