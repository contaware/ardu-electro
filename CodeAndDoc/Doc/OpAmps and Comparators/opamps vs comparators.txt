The opamp output stages are created for linear functioning, with the 
basic purpose of amplifying the input signal. The comparator is built to 
work in saturation mode, switching between the upper and lower supply 
limits. 

- Opamps have a built-in frequency compensation capacitor which reduces 
  the amplification of the high frequencies. At the same time the opamp 
  gets stabler and the tendency to oscillate is diminished. But this 
  built-in capacitor makes the opamp slower with respect to the comparator
  -> only use opamps as comparators in slow circuits.

- A comparator to be used as opamp must have an external output capacitor
  (see the datasheet of ST).

- Most comparators have open-collector outputs (can only sink current), 
  while all opamps have complementary outputs (can source and sink current).
