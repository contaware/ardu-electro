1. Install Arduino IDE

2. File - Preferences - "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

3. Tools - Board - Boards Manager... install:
esp32 by Espressif Systems

4. Select
Tools - Board - ESP32 Arduino - ESP32 PICO-D4
(I have ESP32-PICO-KIT V4.1, the core is ESP32-PICO-D4)

5. While programming you may get: "A fatal error occurred: Failed to 
   connect to ESP32: Wrong boot mode detected (0x13)! The chip needs to
   be in download mode."
-> Hold down the boot button while programming until you see the
   "Connecting..." message in your Arduino IDE.
   
6. The EN button is the reset button.
