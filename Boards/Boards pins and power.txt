I/O pins
--------

1. On AVR platform pins are of type byte (uint8_t), even if many people 
use int. The most common functions are:
* void pinMode(uint8_t pin, uint8_t mode)
* void digitalWrite(uint8_t pin, uint8_t val)     AVR takes ~5μs
* int digitalRead(uint8_t pin)                    AVR takes ~5μs
* void analogWrite(uint8_t pin, int val)          AVR takes ~5μs
* int analogRead(uint8_t pin)                     AVR takes ~100μs
Attention: for the digital functions always use LOW and HIGH enum.
   
2. AVR pins default to inputs (high-impedance state), so they don't need
to be explicitly declared as inputs with pinMode(). Because they are in
a high-impedance state, when switching mode to OUTPUT, we can safely 
assume that the output will be LOW (see explanation from point 3.). 
This holds only for AVR, for other platforms it is not guaranteed!

3. There are 20kΩ pullup resistors built into the AVR chips that can be 
accessed by setting the pinMode() to INPUT_PULLUP. The pullup resistors
are controlled by the same registers (internal chip memory locations) 
that control whether a pin is HIGH or LOW. Consequently, an input pin 
that is configured to have pullup resistors turned on, will output a 
HIGH if it is switched to OUTPUT mode. Note that some documents
erroneously state that switching from OUTPUT mode to INPUT mode will 
leave the pullup state untouched, that used to be so before the 
introduction of INPUT_PULLUP, but now switching to INPUT always disables
pullups and switching to INPUT_PULLUP always enables pullups. Before the 
introduction of INPUT_PULLUP people had to enabled the pullups in two
steps (this still works if pinMode is called before digitalWrite): 
pinMode(pin, INPUT);
digitalWrite(pin, HIGH); // turn on pullup resistor

4. Some digital pins can be used as PWM for analog output. No need to 
call pinMode(pin, OUTPUT) when using analogWrite(), but never call 
digitalWrite() after a analogWrite() call, that will not work on many 
platforms.

5. AVR have analog input pins connected to the channels of one 10-bit 
ADC, those pins can also be used as digital input/output pins, except 
the A6 and A7 of the NANO, PRO MINI and MINIs which are analog inputs 
only. These two analog inputs are not available on the UNO because the 
DIP28 package does not have enough pins. It is possible with the TQFP 
SMD package because it has 32 pins. The analog pins also have pull-up 
resistors, which work identically to pull-up resistors on the digital 
pins. 
Attention: analogRead() will not work correctly if a pin has been 
           previously set to an output, so if this is the case, set it 
           back to an input before using analogRead().

The analog pins can be used as digital pins like digitalRead(A0), look
at the following predefined constants:
#define PIN_A0   (14)        or        #define PIN_A0   (54) // for MEGA
...                                    ...
#define PIN_A7   (21)        or        #define PIN_A15  (69) // for MEGA
static const uint8_t A0 = PIN_A0;
...

To have analogRead(A0) == analogRead(0),... analogRead() does:
if (pin >= 14) pin -= 14;    or    if (pin >= 54) pin -= 54; // for MEGA 

Attention: for non-AVRs, like ESP32, please use A0, A1, A2,... because 
passing 0, 1, 2,... means the GPIO number. Also remember that ESP32 
disables all inputs that direct to the second ADC when WiFi is in use.

6. The Dn constants for digital pins are NOT defined for most Arduinos 
and passing the pin numbers 0,1,2,... to pinMode(), digitalRead() or 
digitalWrite() means digital pins D0, D1, D2,... 
Note: ESP8266 defines Dn constants for the digital pins, not using the 
      Dn constant returns the GPIO with the given number. The association 
      between Dn and GPIO number differs from board to board.


Do not power Arduinos through I/O pins!
---------------------------------------

If power is disconnected then current can flow from an I/O pin through 
the internal clamping diodes to the Vcc line and boot the device. Those 
diodes are however not designed to handle much current, avoid that by 
also disconnecting the ground or add a 10kΩ resistor to the I/O pin.


LED pin
-------

On the official UNO the LED pin 13 is buffered with an opamp, so you 
can use pin 13 freely. On many boards though, the LED is just connected 
directly to the pin, and the load from the LED prevents it from being a 
useful input. The symptom of this (with INPUT_PULLUP set) would be:  
a dim LED and the digitalRead() always returning low. 


Output pin current
------------------

If you drive a mosfet from an Arduino pin without a series resistor, 
then every time the mosfet switches, the input capacitance of the 
mosfet has to be charged or discharged. This results in a current 
pulse, the amplitude of which is limited by the internal resistance of 
the pin given by its mosfets' Rds(on). This resistance is around 20Ω,
so the peak current into or out of the Arduino pin can be as high as 
200mA, way above the absolute maximum rating of 40mA. If we take a 
typical power mosfet with a total gate charge of 20nC, the pulse will 
last for about 100ns. Is a 100ns current pulse of 5x the absolute 
maximum continuous current rating likely to damage the Arduino? I 
suspect the answer is that nobody knows. However, as Atmel does not 
specify a pulse current rating for the output pins, we have to take the 
view that it might. So a series resistor is recommended. A 100Ω series 
resistor will result in a 40mA pulse lasting about 500ns instead.


Emulate an open drain output using and external pull-up resistor
----------------------------------------------------------------

void digitalWriteOpenDrain(uint8_t pin, uint8_t val)
{ 
  if (val == HIGH)
  {
    pinMode(pin, INPUT);
    digitalWrite(pin, LOW); // remove built-in pull-up in case it was HIGH
  }
  else
  { 
    // Above we cannot use pinMode(pin, INPUT_PULLUP) because:
    // 1. The following digitalWrite(pin, LOW) would remove the pull-up resistor 
    //    for a moment before switching to OUTPUT mode with pinMode(pin, OUTPUT).
    // 2. Inverting the order of the following two commands is even worse because
    //    for a moment the OUTPUT would be HIGH!
    digitalWrite(pin, LOW);
    pinMode(pin, OUTPUT);
  }
}
-> as the default state for a pin is INPUT and LOW (NOT INPUT_PULLUP), 
   we could simply switch between the modes. 


Power jack vs Vin
-----------------

Power jack connects to Vin through a diode (see datasheet), so if the 
power jack voltage is greater than the voltage applied to Vin, current 
flows in and can damage the power supply connected to Vin.
Hint: put a tape on the power jack if powering directly into Vin.


Vin vs Vusb
-----------

Because of a power source selection circuitry, it's safe to plug an USB 
cable while there is power on Vin/Power jack:

- On NANO the power source selection is performed by a schottky diode 
  which has 0.3-0.4V of voltage drop. So that the +5V pin is then only 
  at 4.6-4.7V when operating from USB.

- In the UNO and MEGA datasheets we can see that Vin is being monitored 
  by a voltage comparator. When Vin is above 6.6V, the P-channel MOSFET 
  turns OFF (the MOSFET body diode can still conduct). When the MOSFET 
  is ON there is practically no voltage drop.

Note: the LDO regulators have reverse protection diodes, you get power 
      at the Vin pin when supplying from Vusb.


External 5V vs Vusb
-------------------

Care must be taken when powering directly into the 5V pin and at the 
same time attaching an USB cable:

- For the NANO if Vusb < 5V there is no problem because of the diode 
  between Vusb and the 5V. But if Vusb > 5V, then current can flow into 
  your external 5V supply.

- In case of the UNO and MEGA, Vin will be around 4.4V (LDO regulators 
  have reverse protection diodes which let the 5V through it dropping 
  0.6V). That means 2.2V at the comparator, so the P-channel MOSFET will 
  be ON and permit current to flow in both directions. Thus never power 
  an UNO or a MEGA from both USB and the 5V pin at the same time!


Power jack / Vin safe ranges
----------------------------

Most boards:                       7-12V

Nano 33, Nano RP2040 Connect:      5-18V

MKR, Portenta H7, Nicla Sense ME:  5V
Attention: MKR boards when powered through Vin do not output exactly 5V
           on the 5V pin. Moreover when powered by exactly 5.0V the WiFi
           NINA module sometimes does not connect, with 5.2-5.3V there 
           are no problems.

ATtiny85 communication
----------------------

Ports (PB0..PB5) are defined in
C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\avr\include\avr\iotnx5.h
included by Arduino.h -> io.h -> iotn85.h -> iotnx5.h

SPI on these pins (there is no SS, use any pin):
MISO PB1 (physical pin 6)
MOSI PB0 (physical pin 5)
SCK  PB2 (physical pin 7)

I2C:
SDA  PB0 (physical pin 5)

Software serial with CP2102/PL2303/CH340G USB to TTL cable:
- ATTinyCore by Spence Konde supports Serial.begin() and by default
  TX is on PB0 and RX on PB1. The TX pin can be changed with
  Serial.setTxBit() called before Serial.begin().
  Since 2.0.0 it's possible to choose a TX only mode from Tools ->
  Software Serial menu; read() and peek() will always return -1, and 
  available() will always return 0.
- For Digistump AVR Boards by ArminJo there is the TX only
  ATtinySerialOut.hpp library which uses fixed baud-rates (default is
  115200). TX is by default on PB2, that can be changed with a
  #define TX_PIN PB0 before the #include "ATtinySerialOut.hpp".
- For the Adafruit Trinket boards use the built-in SoftwareSerial lib:
  #include <SoftwareSerial.h>
  SoftwareSerial Serial(PB1, PB0); // RX, TX
  Attention: flash at 8MHz otherwise it does not work.
