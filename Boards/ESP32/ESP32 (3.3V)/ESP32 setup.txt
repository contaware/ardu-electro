1. Install Arduino IDE

2. File - Preferences - "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json

3. Tools - Board - Boards Manager... install:
   esp32 by Espressif Systems

4. Select
   Tools - Board - esp32 - ...
   Note: if available, the "USB CDC On Boot" option must be set to 
         "Enabled" for Serial print to work.

5. If COM port is not showing up, install the CP210x USB to UART Bridge 
   Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers (for Windows choose the Universal 
   Windows Driver):

6. While programming you may get: "A fatal error occurred: Failed to 
   connect to ESP32: Wrong boot mode detected (0x13)! The chip needs to
   be in download mode."
   -> Hold down the boot button while programming until you see the
      "Connecting..." message in your Arduino IDE.

7. Often EN means the reset button.
