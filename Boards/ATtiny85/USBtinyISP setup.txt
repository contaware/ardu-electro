1. Install Arduino IDE

2. File - Preferences - "Additional Boards Manager URLs":
https://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json

3. Tools - Board - Boards Manager... install:
ATTinyCore by Spence Konde

4. It may be necessary to download & install adafruit_drivers_x.x.x.x.exe 
for USBtinyISP support:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Windows_Drivers/releases/

5. Select Tools - Board - ATTinyCore - ATtiny25/45/85 (No bootloader)

6. Choose Tools - Programmer - USBtinyISP

7. Call Tools - Burn Bootloader to set the fuses, that's necessary the
   first time or if you change the MCU frequency.

8. Call Sketch - Upload Using Programmer


Fuses
-----

The fuses can only be set via ISP programming. If "ATtiny25/45/85 
(No bootloader)" is selected, then calling Tools - Burn Bootloader just 
sets the fuses.

The fuses are 3 bytes of permanent, but re-settable, storage. Classic 
AVR chips are configured by default to run from the 8 MHz internal 
oscillator divided by 8, that's 1 MHz. That may be the reason why your 
first uploaded Blink sketch flashes at a 8 sec rate instead of the 
expected 1 sec rate.
