Flash new micronucleus bootloader
---------------------------------

For DigiSpark ATtiny85 flash the recommended micronucleus bootloader 
with fastExit which removes the default 5-6 seconds user program start 
wait time.

1. Open console and change directory to the wanted bootloader .hex files:
Get files from https://github.com/ArminJo/micronucleus-firmware/tree/master/firmware/upgrades
or use the ones from ATTinyCore:
> cd "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arduino15\packages\ATTinyCore\hardware\avr\x.y.z\bootloaders\micronucleus"

2. Flash with:
> "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Arduino15\packages\ATTinyCore\tools\micronucleus\x.y.z\micronucleus.exe" --no-ansi --run --timeout 60 upgrade-t85_entry_on_powerOn_activePullup_fastExit.hex
