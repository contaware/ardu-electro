/* 
  Use a H-bridge to drive LEDs bidirectionally

  - To fully illuminate a light chain/string made of LEDs in alternating 
    polarity, we have to fast switch the polarity so that the eye does 
    not see a flickering.

  - The dimming regulation is achieved through a 10kÎ© potentiometer.

  - Do not forget an output resistor to limit the current into the LEDs. 
    Even better would be a H-bridge with current limitation.
