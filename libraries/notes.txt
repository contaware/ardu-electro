Libraries installation
----------------------

There are two possibilities:

1. Copy the wanted libraries to your Sketchbook/libraries location
   (get the exact path from your Arduino IDE's Preferences dialog).

2. Make links in Sketchbook/libraries location to the wanted libraries.
   For example in Windows as admin do:
   mklink /D "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\libraries\MyLib" "C:\path\libraries\MyLib"
