# Extensive documentation with code about Arduino and Electronics

This is not an Arduino programming tutorial or electronics course, but a collection of reference examples with notes for **Arduino**, **modules** and **electronic circuits**. The main difference to the official Arduino examples, is that for each example you will find **extensive documentation inside the sketch file** and often **separate notes with pictures**.

All the documents are licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), while **our code snippets/examples are in public domain** because they do not meat the threshold of originality. Bear in mind that if two programmers provide substantially the same code snippets/examples for a given task, then that's considered non-original. Nevertheless, to reassure everyone, we explicitly release our code snippets/examples into the public domain under the [CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.

All of this has been created and collected over many years of working with Arduino and electronics projects. We took care to **avoid including copyrighted material**, but it is still possible that we overlooked something. If that's the case, please let us know and we will remove it without hesitation.
