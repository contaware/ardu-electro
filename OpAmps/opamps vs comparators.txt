The opamp output stages are created for linear functioning, with the 
basic purpose of amplifying the input signal. The comparator is built 
to work in saturation mode, switching between the upper and lower 
supply limits. 

- Opamps have a built-in frequency compensation capacitor which 
  reduces the amplification of the high frequencies. At the same time 
  the opamp gets stabler and the tendency to oscillate is diminished. 
  This built-in capacitor makes the opamp slower with respect to 
  the comparator; it's possible to use opamps as comparators, but only
  in slow applications.

- The "Microchip PICmicro® Comparator Tips ‘n Tricks" document and the   
  LM393 datasheet of ST have examples of making an opamp out of a   
  comparator by adding a capacitor, but I would not do that!

- Most comparators have open-collector outputs (can only sink 
  current), while all opamps have complementary outputs (can source and 
  sink current).
