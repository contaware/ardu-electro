Parallel BJTs
-------------

BJTs conduct better when getting warmer, to avoid this thermal run-away, 
a negative feedback emitter resistor (or ballast resistor) of 1Î© or less 
has to be added.


Parallel MOSFETs as switch
--------------------------

MOSFETs in linear region have RDS(on) increasing with temperature, so 
they are self-balancing. If one has a lower resistance it will 
initially take more of the parallel group current. This causes that 
MOSFET to get hotter than the others, its resistance goes up and so its 
current decreases, balancing the current distribution across the 
parallel MOSFETs.


Parallel MOSFETs as amplifier
-----------------------------

MOSFETs in saturation region behave like BJTs, source resistors have to
be used.


Parallel IGBTs
--------------

IGBTs, being a combination of MOSFET and BJT, cannot be described as 
having either a negative or a positive temperature coefficient. Always 
consult the datasheet.
