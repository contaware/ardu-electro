JFET vs MOSFET
--------------

- JFET is more used in low-power applications, as opposed to MOSFET 
  which excels in high-power.

- JFET exhibits lower noise, but has a small current flowing in/out of 
  the gate.
  
- JFET's VDS - ID output characteristics in the saturation region is 
  flatter than the one of the MOSFET.
